# To set the correct Sleep hash, do the following

# 1.) Make up a sleep phrase. This is a sentence you need to write
#     to the ~/actor~sleep file in your home directory. Ideally,
#     this will be something you commit to memory and know by heart,
#     and will disencourage you from cheating. For example, any
#     promise to your self that you will not procrastinate and you
#     will use this bypass option only in need.

# 2.) Generate the hash from your sleep phrase. Just write your sleep
#     phrase into the ~/actor-sleep file and run the function 
#     generate_hash below

# 3.) Hardcode the hash printed here.

SLEEP_HASH = 'your-sleep-hashphrase-sha1-hash'
